## Summary
  According to this data set there is not a positivity bias for reviews from the vine program. the reviews by vine participants do not have an increase in positive reviews relative the the non-Vine reviews. However, the Vine review count is quite low and may require a larger sample to know with more certainty if payment for reviews influences a positivity bias. 
  While there is not a large difference in percentage of positive reviews between vine and non-vine, nearly all the reviews that are from the vine program are not verified. This suggests that those participating in the program are writing random reviews for products they have never used. In order to look at this more in depth an isolation of all the verified purchases would be helpful to remove the possibility of bots or false/inaccurate reviews.
